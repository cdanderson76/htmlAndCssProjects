                When someone is learning a programming language for the first time, the first line of code is often code that will produce the text 'Hello World'. Being that this is one of my first visual projects in which I design my own layout, I just figured that it would be most appropriate to name this my 'Hello World' project.  Thanks for viewing, and I hope you like it!

            <p class="paragraph-text">This project is soley based on HTML (Hypertext-Markup-Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheet).  HTML is essentially the 'noun' when referring to front-end web development, and its responsibility is to provide structure and content to web pages.  This is done through a number of elements, and when combined together, they tell the browser how to show the content.  CSS, on the other hand, is the 'adjective' of front-end web development.  Its purpose is HOW to visually display the content on a web page (it is even responsible for all of the fancy hover effects on this page!)  CSS produces the style of font, colors, margins, borders, shapes...you name it!  Getting to know CSS is imperative!</p>

            <h2 class="headings">JavaScript</h2>
            <p class="paragraph-text">Although I chose not to include JavaScript in this particular project, as this is completely visual, I would like to include the definition of it's purpose.  JavaScript is the 'verb' when referring to front-end web development.  It makes our buttons function, creates cool animations on our web pages, and allows for the creation of many other interactive elements such as calculations and pop up messages.  While I will continue to gain familiarity with CSS, I look forward to implementing JavaScript in future projects.</p>
